/*
 SQLite does not support "Dropping foreign key" out of the box, we do not generate automatic migration for that, so it has to be done manually
 Please refer to: https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/tables/alter_table.php

 Due to that we don't generate migration automatically and it has to be done manually
